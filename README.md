# letsleetcode-python
Let's LeetCode in Python. This is a repository for me to track my process of cracking leetcode in python. 

## Jupyter Book Basics
This repository relies on the use of open-source [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/start/build.html).

To build the book, run 

    jb build letsleetcode/

To preview your book, you can open the generated HTML files in your browser. Either double-click the html file in your local folder, or enter the absolute path to the file in your browser navigation bar adding *file://* at the beginning (e.g. *file://Users/my_path_to_book/_build/index.html*).
