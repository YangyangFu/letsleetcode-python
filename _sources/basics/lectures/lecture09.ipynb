    "## Rrepresentations of Graph\n",
    "There are two ways to represent a graph $G = (V, E)$: as a collection of adjacency lists or an adjacency matrix. Either way applies to both directed and undirected graphs.\n",
    "- Adjacnecy-list representation provides a compact way to represent **Sparse** graphs: $|E|$ is way less than $|V^2|$.\n",
    "- Adjacency-matrix representation when the graph is dense\n",
    "    - can help quickly to tell if there is an edge connecting two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "![graph-representation](./resources/l9-graph-representation.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjancency-list Representation\n",
    "- The graph $G=(V,E)$ consist of an array `G.Adj` of $|V|$ lists, one for each $V$.\n",
    "- For each $u \\in V$, the adjacency list $Adj[u]$ containts all the vertices $v$ such that there is an edge $(u,v) \\in E$, or contains pointers to these vertices.\n",
    "- The sum of length of all the adjacency lists\n",
    "    - $2*|E|$ for undirected graph\n",
    "    - $|E|$ for directed graph\n",
    "- Similarly, we can define an associated attirbute $w$ as $G.w$ to represent weighted graphs. -. $G.w[u]$.\n",
    "- Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - $O(|E|)$ time to determine if an edge $(u, v)$ is present in the graph              \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjancency-matrix Representation\n",
    "- The adjacency matrix $A$ is $|V|$-by-$|V|$ so that $a_{i,j} = 1$ if $(i, j)\\in E$ else 0            \n",
    "- Requires $O(V^2)$ space\n",
    "- Preferred when graphs are reasonably small.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of Vertex/Edge Attributes\n",
    "- Attributes such as adjacency list, weights can be annotated as `G.Adj, G.w`. \n",
    "- Similar for vertice or edge attributes: `u.d, (u,v).f` etc.\n",
    "- But how to implement these attributes in programs??\n",
    "    - depends on language and algorthm needs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breadth-First Search\n",
    "- Given a graph $G$ and a distinguished source $s$, BFS explores the edge of $G$ to discover every vertex that is reachable from s and return a `breadth-first tree` with root `s` that contains the `shortest path` from `s` to `v` for each `v` reachable from `s`.\n",
