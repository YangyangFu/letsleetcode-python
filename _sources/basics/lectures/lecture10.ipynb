    "\n",
    "##  Overview\n",
    "- search `deeper` wherever possible\n",
    "- solve single source reacheability, not shortest path problem. Will be useful for solving other problems (later at XXX).\n",
    "- return parent tree or forest (e.g., multiple trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "## DFS\n",
    "- could run from a single source or multiple source\n",
    "- As in breadth-first search, depth-first search colors vertices during the search to indicate their state. \n",
    "    Each vertex is initially white, is grayed when it is discovered in the search, and is blackened when it is finished, that is, when its adjacency list has been examined completely. \n",
    "    This technique guarantees that each vertex ends up in exactly one depth-first tree, so that these trees are disjoint.\n",
    "- Besides creating a depth-first forest, depth-first search also timestamps each vertex. \n",
    "    - Each vertex `v` has two timestamps: the first timestamp `v.d` records when `v` is first discovered (and grayed), \n",
    "    and the second timestamp `v.f` records when the search finishes examining `v`â€™s adjacency list (and blackens `v`).\n",
    "    - The timestamps provide important information about the structure of the graph and are generally helpful in reasoning about the behavior of DFS\n",
    "    - The timestamps are integers between `1` and `2|V|`.\n",
    "    - For each `v`, $v.d < v.f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- algorithm: `DFS(G,s)`\n",
    "    - initialize global time stamp\n",
    "    - mark the source vertice as gray, being explored\n",
    "    - for vertex `v` in the adjacency list of `s`, if not explored yet, run `DFS(G,v)` recursively\n",
    "    - mark source verice as black, finishing exploration\n",
    "    - update time stamp by 1\n",
    "    - assign final timestamp for source vertex\n",
