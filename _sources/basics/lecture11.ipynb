    "# Lecture 11: Weighted Shortest Path\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Overview\n",
    "- BFS in [Lecture 9](./lecture9.ipynb) can find the shortest path in graph `G` from given source `s`. But it only usable for unit-weighted graph, where the weights of all edges are 1. The distance of each vertex `v` in terms of `s` is counted by the number of edges between `s` and `v`.\n",
    "- BFS is a `single source shortest-paths` problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variants\n",
    " - in `shortest-paths problem`, we are given a `weighted, directed` graph $G=(V,E)$ with weight function `w` mapping edges to real-valued weights.\n",
    "    - the weight of a path `p=(v0, v1, v2,..., vk)` as `w(p)` is the sum of weights of its constituent edges: $w(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}w(v_{i-1}, v_i)$\n",
    "    - define the `shortest-path weight` $\\delta(u,v)$ from $u$ to $v$ by $\\delta(u,v) = min{w(p): u\\rightarrow v} \\ \\text{if path exist else}\\ \\infty$\n",
    "    - a `shortest path` from $u$ to $v$ is then defined as any path `p` with weight $w(p) = \\delta(u,v).\n",
    "   \n",
    "- `single-destination shortest-paths problem`: find a shortest path to a given destination vertex $t$ from each vertex $v$. We can reverse the directoin of each edges in the graph, and reduce this problem to a `single-source` problem.\n",
    "- `single-pair shortest-path problem`: Find a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ for given vertices $u$ and $v$. If we solve the single-source problem with source vertex $u$, we solve this problem also.\n",
    "- `all-pairs shortest-paths problem`: Find a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$. Although we can solve this problem by running a single- source algorithm once from each vertex, we usually can solve it faster. (later in XXX)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative-weight edges\n",
    "- `Negative-weight cycles`:\n",
    "    - the weight of the cyclic path is negative\n",
    "    - If the graph contains a negative-weight cycle reachable from $s$, however, shortest-path weights are not well defined. \n",
    "    - No path from $s$ to a vertex on the cycle can be a shortest path—we can always find a path with lower weight by following the proposed “shortest” path and then traversing the negative-weight cycle. \n",
    "    - If there is a negative-weight cycle on some path from $s$ to $v$, we define $\\delta(s,v)=\\infty$.\n",
    "- Some shortest-paths algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, assume that all edge weights in the input graph are nonnegative, as in the road-map example. \n",
    "- Others, such as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, allow negative-weight edges in the in- put graph and produce a correct answer as long as no negative-weight cycles are reachable from the source. \n",
    "- Typically, if there is such a negative-weight cycle, the algorithm can detect and report its existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing shortest paths\n",
    " - similar to BFS trees\n",
    " - shortest paths are not necessarily unique, and neither are shortest-trees.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Relaxation\n",
    " - for each vertex $v \\in V$, we maintain an attribute $v.d$, which is an upper bound on the weight of a shortest path from source $s$ to $v$.\n",
    " - initialize the shortest-path estimates and predecessors in $o(V)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    "    def initialize_single_source(G,s):\n",
    "        for v in G.V:\n",
    "            v.d = infinity\n",
    "            v.p = None\n",
    "        s.d = 0\n",
    " ```\n",
    "- The process of relaxing an edge $(u,v)$ consists of testing whether we can improve the shortest path to $v$ found so far by going through $u$ and, if so, updating $v.d$ and $v.p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def relax(u,v,w):\n",
    "        if v.d > u.d + w(u,v):\n",
    "            v.d = u.d + w(u,v)\n",
    "            v.p = u\n",
    "```\n",
