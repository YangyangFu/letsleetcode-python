    "# 0123 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III\n",

    "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.\n",
    "Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n",
    "Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.\n",
