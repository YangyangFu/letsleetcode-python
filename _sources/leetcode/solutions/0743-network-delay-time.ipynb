    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the minimum time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 <= k <= n <= 100\n",
    "1 <= times.length <= 6000\n",
    "times[i].length == 3\n",
    "1 <= ui, vi <= n\n",
    "ui != vi\n",
    "0 <= wi <= 100\n",
    "All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)\n",
