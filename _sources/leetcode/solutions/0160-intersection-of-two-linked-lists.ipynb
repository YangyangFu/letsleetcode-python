    "# 0160 Intersection of Two Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples \n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\n",
    "Output: Intersected at '8'\n",
    "Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\n",
    "From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n",
    "- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\n",
    "Output: Intersected at '2'\n",
    "Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\n",
    "From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2\n",
    "Output: No intersection\n",
    "Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\n",
    "Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "```\n",
    "The number of nodes of listA is in the m.\n",
    "The number of nodes of listB is in the n.\n",
    "1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104\n",
    "1 <= Node.val <= 105\n",
    "0 <= skipA < m\n",
    "0 <= skipB < n\n",
    "intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.\n",
    "intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.\n",
    "```"

    "## Analysis\n",
    "**Method 1**: hash map\n",
    "- create an empty hash set\n",
    "- traverse the first linked list, and store the visited node in the hash set\n",
    "- traverse the second linked list. Check if it is present in the hash set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method might requires all nodes have unique value. The example 2 probably will not pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merhod 2**: two pointer method\n",
    "- if two pointers `p1` and `p2` walks normally on two lists, they cannot meet each other at the intersection. Then how can the two pointers can meet at the intersection?\n",
    "- we can link these two lists together\n",
    "  - traverse list 1, and then traverse list 2\n",
    "  - traverse list 2, and then traverse list 1\n",
    "  - if there is an intersection, the two pointers will have the same node\n",
    "- The idea can be described as the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![figure 1](./resources/0160-1.jpeg)\n",
    "![figure 2](./resources/0160-2.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 3**: two pointer method\n",
    "- in cycle detection, we have algorithms to detect the cycle entrance, which is similar to intersection dectection\n",
    "- we can formulate a cycle out of these two intersected lists\n",
    "  - make list 1 a circular list by connecting its last node to its first node -> make a cycle\n",
    "  - detect the cycle entrance starting from the head of list 2\n",
    "  - remove the circular list\n",
