    "There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array prerequisites where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.\n",
