    "# Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems which incrementally builds candidates to the solution and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is due to this backtracking behaviour, the backtracking algorithms are often much faster than the brute-force search algorithm, since it eliminates many unnecessary exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def backtrack(candidate):\n",
    "    if find_solution(candidate):\n",
    "        output(candidate)\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # iterate all possible candidates.\n",
    "    for next_candidate in list_of_candidates:\n",
    "        if is_valid(next_candidate):\n",
    "            # try this partial candidate solution\n",
    "            place(next_candidate)\n",
    "            # given the candidate, explore further.\n",
    "            backtrack(next_candidate)\n",
    "            # backtrack\n",
    "            remove(next_candidate)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the enumeration of candidates is done in two levels:\n",
    "- at the first level, the function is implemented as recursion. At each occurrence of recursion, the function is one step further to the final solution.\n",
    "- as the second level, within the recursion, we have an iteration that allows us to explore all the candidates that are of the same progress to the final solution."
