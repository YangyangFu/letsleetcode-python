    "# Big-O Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "$O$ is known as the Big-Oh notion to comparatively analyze the time complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constant Time\n",
    "\n",
    "$O(1)$: function with constant time complexity, which means the execution time of such a function is independent of its input sizes. \n",
    "An example in Python is the function `len(list)`.\n",
    "This is a very simple algorithm becausethelistclass maintains, for each list, an instance variable that records the currentlength of the list.  \n",
    "This allows it to immediately report that length, rather than taketime to iteratively count each of the elements in the list. \n",
    "Using asymptotic notation,we say that this function runs in $O(1)$ time. \n",
    "Another example is the indexing of a list in Python, such as `data[j]`.\n",
    "The indexing operation also has constant-time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logorithm Time\n",
    "$O(logn)$: logarithm time \n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Time\n",
    "$O(n)$: the time for the linear time algorithm to solve a problem linearly grows with the size of the problem. \n",
    "The following function `fun_max2` is used to find the maximum value from a given list. \n",
    "`L2` is an indexing operation and an assignment, and both operations are constant-time $O(1)$.\n",
    "`L3` is a for loop, which executes `n` times (`n` is the length of the given list), and needs $O(n)$ time during operation.\n",
    "Inside the loop, there is a comparison and a possible assignment operation, both of which require $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "Thus the whole loop requires $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "`L6` is a return operation, which needs $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "Therefore, in total, this complexity of this algorithm is $O(1)+O(n)*O(1)+O(1)$, which is $O(n)$.\n",

    "$O(n^2)$: the time for the quadratic time algorithm to solve a problem quadratically grow with the size of the problem. \n",
    "An example is to find the `prefix averages` of a sequence of numbers. \n",
    "Given a sequence $S$ consisting of $n$ numbers, we want to calculate a sequence $A$ such that $A[j]$ is the average of elements $S[0], S[1], ..., S[]j$, for $j = 0,1, ..., n-1$, that is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$A[j] = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{j}S[i]}{j+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following algorithm `prefix_average1` renders a comlexity of $O(n^2)$, which computes every element of $A$ separately, using an inner loop to compute the partial sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `L2` executes in constant time.\n",
    "- `L3` initializes a Python list with length of $n$ with entries of 0. This uses a constant number of primitive operations per element and thus run in $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "- `L4` is an outer loop that executes $n$ times. The body of the outer loop in `L5, L8` executes in constant time. \n",
    "- `L6, L7` is an inner loop that execute $j+1$ times, depending the current counter $j$. Thus `L7` executes $1+2+3+, ..., +n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ times in total within the outer loop, which is $O(n^2)$ for $L4-L7$. \n",
    "- Thus, the code in toal is $O(1) + O(n) + O(n^2)$, and considerd as $O(n^2)$.\n",
