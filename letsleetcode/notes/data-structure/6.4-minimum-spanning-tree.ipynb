    "# 6.4 Minimum Spanning Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wish to connect all the computers in a new office building using the least amount of cable.  \n",
    "We can model this problem using an undirected, weighted graph `G` whose  vertices  represent  the  computers,  and  whose  edges  represent  all the possible pairs `(u,v)` of computers,  where the weight `w(u,v)` of `edge(u,v)` is equal to the amount of cable needed to connect computer `u` to computer `v`.\n",
    "Rather than computing a shortest-path tree from some particular vertex `v`, we are interested instead in finding a tree `T` that contains all the vertices of `G` and has the minimum total weight over all such trees. \n",
    "Algorithms for finding such a tree are the focus of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree, such as this, that contains every vertex of a connected graph `G` is said to be a `spanning tree`, and the problem of computing a spanning tree `T` with smallest total weight is known as the `minimum spanning tree(MST)` problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two algorithms are popular to solve this problem: Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.\n",
    "These two algorithms are both `greedy` algorithms, as at each step of iteration, they choose the object that is the best at the moment. \n",
    "Such a strategy doesn't always ganrantee that it will always find globally optimal solutions to problems.\n",
    "However, for a `MST` problem, we can prove that certain greedy strategies do yield a spanning tree with minimum weight.\n"
