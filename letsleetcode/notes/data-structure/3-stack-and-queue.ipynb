    "A stack or LIFO (last in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: \n",
    "- push, which adds an element to the collection, and \n",
    "- pop, which removes the last element that was added. \n",
    " \n",
    "In stack both the operations of push and pop take place at the same end that is top of the stack. It can be implemented by using both array and linked list.  \n",

    "Stacks are used for maintaining function calls (the last called function must finish execution first), `we can always remove recursion with the help of stacks`. \n",
    "Stacks are also used in cases where we have to `reverse a word`, `check for balanced parenthesis`, and in editors where the word you typed the last is the first to be removed when you use undo operation. Similarly, to implement back functionality in web browsers.\n"

    "### Stock Span Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of `n` daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate the span of the stock’s price for all `n` days. \n",
    "The span `Si` of the stock’s price on a given day `i` is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than its price on the given day. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: N = 7, price[] = [100 80 60 70 60 75 85]\n",
    "Output: 1 1 1 2 1 4 6\n",
    "Explanation: Traversing the given input span for 100 will be 1, 80 is smaller than 100 so the span is 1, 60 is smaller than 80 so the span is 1, 70 is greater than 60 so the span is 2 and so on. Hence the output will be 1 1 1 2 1 4 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: N = 6, price[] = [10 4 5 90 120 80]\n",
    "Output:1 1 2 4 5 1\n",
    "Explanation: Traversing the given input span for 10 will be 1, 4 is smaller than 10 so the span will be 1, 5 is greater than 4 so the span will be 2 and so on. Hence, the output will be 1 1 2 4 5 1.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "- this is very similar to the next question to find the index of the previous cloest greater element\n",
    "- algorithm:\n",
    "  - initiate a stack to store the index of the traversed value, a span with -1 to store the span value for each element\n",
    "  - traverse from left to right\n",
    "    - if the stack s is empty, then push current index to the stack\n",
    "    - if the current value < the value at the top index of the stack s, then previous closest greater value for current index is met. We can simply get the difference between these two indexes to get the span.\n",
    "      - push the current index to stack\n",
    "    - if the current value > the value at the top inddex of the stack s\n",
    "      - pop the stack until the current value < the value at the top index of the stack s or the stack is empty\n",
    "      - calculate the span based on index\n",
