    "# 0695. Max Area of Island\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an `m x n` binary matrix grid. An island is a group of `1's` (representing land) connected `4-directionally` (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the `maximum area` of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "m == grid.length\n",
    "n == grid[i].length\n",
    "1 <= m, n <= 50\n",
    "grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.\n",
    "```"
