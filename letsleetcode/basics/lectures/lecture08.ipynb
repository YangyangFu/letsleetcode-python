    "## Trees in Arrays\n",
    "The previous lectures store a binary tree with the help of pointer-liked structures, in which each item contains references to its children. \n",
    "If the tree is a `complete binary tree`, there is a useful `array-based` alternative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**. A binary tree is complete if every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all the leaves on the last level are placed as far to the left as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete binary tree is one that can be obtained by filling the nodes starting with the root, and then each next level in turn, always from the left, until one runs out of nodes. \n",
    "Complete binary trees always have minimal height for their size $n$, namely $logn$, and are always perfectly balanced.\n",

    "    - parent(i) = $A[floor(\\frac{i-1}{2})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storing a binary tree as an array is not efficient \n",
    "    - if the tree is not complete, reserve space in the array for every possible node in the tree\n",
    "    - for binary search tree, insertion or deletion will involve shifting large portions of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heaps\n",
    "- The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree.\n",
    "    - Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. \n",
    "    - The tree is completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point\n",
    "    - An array A that represents a heap is an object with two attributes: `A.length`, which (as usual) gives the number of elements in the array, and `A.heap-size`, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array `A`.\n",
    "    - Given the index `i`, we can easily calculate its parent, left and right child based on the way they are stored.\n",
    "- Max-heap:\n",
    "    - `max-heap property`: for every node `i` except the root, $A[parent(i)] >= A[i]$\n",
    "    - `max-heap` is an array satisfying max-heap property at all nodes\n",
    "    - **Min-heap** is symmetric\n",
    "- Heap operations\n",
    "    - the height of the tree is $floor(logn)$. The height for each node $i$ is $floor(logn) - floor(log(i+1))$\n",

    "        - iterate from `n/2` to `0`\n",
    "            - the appendix array A[n/2:n] is at the bottom level (leafs) of a max-heap, and doesn't need `max_heapify`\n",
    "        - recursively use `max_heapify_down(A, i)`\n",
    "        - this build takes $O(n)$ time\n",
    "        - if build from a top-down manne using `max_heapify_up(A,i)`, the time complexity is $O(nlogn)$ as the bottom of the tree (where most elements align) have to be `max_heapify` $logn$ time for each node.\n",

    "        The exact makeup of the handle (such as a pointer or an integer) depends on the application. \n",
